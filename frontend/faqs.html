    <h2>FAQs & Case Studies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      
      <h3>Aadhaar linked vs DBT seeded – what's the difference?</h3>
      <p>&#x2022; Aadhaar Linked → Your Aadhaar is stored in your bank’s records.
        <br>
      &#x2022; DBT Seeded → Your Aadhaar is mapped to your bank account in the NPCI database, which is required for Direct Benefit Transfers.b
      <br>
         👉 Example: If you linked Aadhaar at Bank A but seeded Aadhaar at Bank B, your DBT will go to Bank B, not A.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>I have linked Aadhaar, but DBT is not received. Why?</h3>
      <p>&#x2022;Your NPCI mapping may be inactive or pointing to another bank.
        <br>
        &#x2022;Always confirm with your chosen bank and submit consent to seed Aadhaar with NPCI.
        <br>
        👉 Check your mapping status on NPCI Aadhaar Mapper or through your bank’s DBT desk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How do I check if my Aadhaar is DBT seeded?</h3>
      <p>&#x2022;Use your bank’s DBT/UIDAI Aadhaar Seeding Checker.
        <br>
         &#x2022;Visit your bank branch and request a DBT Seeding Confirmation Slip.
         <br>
         &#x2022;NPCI has a “Check Aadhaar Mapper” service on bank apps/websites.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I have Aadhaar seeded in more than one bank?</h3>
      <p>&#x2022;❌ Only one bank account can be active at a time in NPCI’s DBT mapper.
      <br>
      &#x2022;You seed in another bank, the previous one becomes inactive.
      <br>
      👉 Example: If you move from SBI to PNB, your DBT will stop going to SBI once NPCI updates to PNB.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
    <h3>How can I change my DBT receiving bank account?</h3>
    <p>&#x2022;A fresh Aadhaar seeding consent form at your new bank.
    <br>
    &#x2022;Your old bank mapping is updated as inactive.
    <br>
    Confirm with NPCI/Bank SMS that mapping now points to the new account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What precautions should I take against phishing and fraud?</h3>
      <p>&#x2022;Share OTP, PIN, or Aadhaar details on calls/messages.
       <br>
       &#x2022;Only trust messages from UIDAI, NPCI, or your bank’s official number.
       <br>
       &#x2022;Always type URLs yourself—don’t click on random links.
        <br>
        &#x2022;👉 Example: UIDAI SMSes come from UIDAI-VCIP or UIDAI-OTP. Ignore anything else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What happens if I close my DBT seeded bank account?</h3>
      <p>&#x2022;DBT transfers will fail until you seed Aadhaar in another active account.
      <br>
      &#x2022;Ensure at least one active bank account is NPCI mapped before closing your old account.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
    <h3>Can scholarships fail if Aadhaar is linked but not seeded?</h3>
    <p>&#x2022;✅ Linking ≠ Seeding.
